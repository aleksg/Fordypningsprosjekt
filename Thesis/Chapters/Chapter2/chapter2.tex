\label{background}


This chapter will give a brief introduction to the history behind the BLOPP project [insert reference] and the CAPP, GAPP and Karotz applications.


\section{BLOPP Project}
Barns Legemiddelopplevelser is a project group ...

\subsection{CAPP/GAPP/Karotz project}
In the fall of 2012 Aaberg, Aarseth, Dale, Gisvold and Svalestuen were engaged by the BLOPP Project group through the course TDT4290 - Customer Driven Project [Insert reference] at NTNU. They were set to develop a prototype for a tangible medical reminder for asthmatic children. The work was done between August 2012 and December 2012, and a full report of their work is available at [Insert Reference]. 
Their prototype is the foundation for our work in this project.


\section{CAPP/GAPP/KAPP}
The prototype mentioned in the previuos section resulted in three separate applications named CAPP, GAPP and KAPP. 

\subsection{CAPP}
CAPP is an Android application targeted towards the children.  

PICTURES, OR IT DIDN'T HAPPEN!

\subsection{GAPP}
GAPP is an Android application targeted towards the parents or the guardians of the children. CAPP and GAPP works together as a pair, so a child may only have one parent and vice versa.


\subsection{Known areas for improvement}
As Aaberg, Aarseth, Dale, Gisvold and Svalestuen finished their work, they commented on several areas of potential improvement for CAPP/GAPP/KAPP. This document is reprinted in its entirety in appendix XXX (after permission from Aaberg, Aarseth, Dale, Gisvold and Svalestuen). The main topics for improvement were
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Reward System}
\item{Distraction sequence for children}
\item{Web application}
\item{Support for more children}
\end{enumerate}

These comments will be used as a basis when we decide what to improve in this project.
