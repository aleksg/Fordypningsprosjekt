\chapter{Background}
\label{chp:background}


This chapter will give a brief introduction to the history behind the BLOPP project [insert reference] and the CAPP, GAPP and Karotz applications.


\section{BLOPP Project}
\label{sec:bloppproject}
Barns Legemiddelopplevelser is a project group ...

\subsection{CAPP/GAPP/Karotz project}
In the fall of 2012 Aaberg, Aarseth, Dale, Gisvold and Svalestuen were engaged by the BLOPP Project group through the course TDT4290 - Customer Driven Project \cite{customerdrivenntnu} at NTNU. They were set to develop a prototype for a tangible medical reminder for asthmatic children. The work was done between August 2012 and December 2012, and a full report of their work is available at [Insert Reference]. 
Their prototype is the foundation for our work in this project.


\section{CAPP/GAPP/KAPP}
\label{sec:cappgappkapp}
The prototype mentioned in the previuos section resulted in three separate applications named CAPP, GAPP and KAPP. These are described in an overview below.  

\subsection{GAPP}
GAPP is an Android application targeted towards the parents or the guardians of the children. 
It's basic functionality is to view logs of how often a child needs medication, how the child has been feeling the latest couple of days, according to the asthma traffic light system, and to set up alarms for the child. 
CAPP and GAPP works together as a pair, so a child may only have one parent and vice versa. %Er siste setning n√∏dvendig?


\subsection{CAPP}
CAPP is an Android application targeted towards the children. It launches the alarms given by parents and guides children during their medication. After a medication is complete, the child gets a star in it's treasure chest.    

PICTURES, OR IT DIDN'T HAPPEN!


\subsection{KAPP}
KAPP is another application targeted towards children. The application runs on a Karotz[Insert Reference], which is a small robot bunny (Bilde?). The purpose of the Karotz is to give reminders to children when it's time to take their asthma medicine, and give instructions during medication. In order to interact with the Karotz, children may use either a Nanoz (a small bunny with an integrated RFID) or by pressing a button on the top of the Karotz' head.    

\subsection{Known areas for improvement}
\label{sec:improvements}
As Aaberg, Aarseth, Dale, Gisvold and Svalestuen finished their work, they commented on several areas of potential improvement for CAPP/GAPP/KAPP. This document is reprinted in its entirety in appendix XXX (after permission from Aaberg, Aarseth, Dale, Gisvold and Svalestuen). The main topics for improvement were
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Reward System}
\item{Distraction sequence for children}
\item{Web application}
\item{Support for more children}
\end{enumerate}

These comments will be used as a basis when we decide what to improve in this project.
