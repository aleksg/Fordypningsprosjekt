On the two biggest application stores, Google Play and iOS AppStore, it exists a couple of similar applications to the one we have in mind. Among those we have looked into, is Huff and Puff, Asthma Logger, Kids Beating Asthma and Asthma Monitor. Common for all applications is that they have one specific aim. For instance, Huff and Puff wants to teach children in general about asthma. Asthma Logger logs treatments, and Kids Beating Asthma have some game elements, but none of these games are able to play during medication.

	\begin{itemize}

Although neither applications serve all the purposes we wanted for CAPP and GAPP, they do have some useful elements. For instance, Asthma Logger allows for sending the journal to an email-address specified by the user. This implies that the user can send their journal to their own email, and forward this to their doctor, who can then respond to whether the child should get an appointment. This also simplifies the doctor's process when the child comes to his/her appointment, as much of the data needed is already on the doctor's computer. 


In addition, both Kids Beating Asthma and Huff And Puff have some decent information, and have gamified the teaching of this information into quizzes, which is a good idea to incorporate into our own application.
