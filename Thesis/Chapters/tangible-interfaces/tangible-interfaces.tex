This chapter will introduce the reader to Tangible Interfaces, and elaborate on some existing research that has been done on the concept.   

\section{About tangible interfaces}

In 1997, Ishii et. al. presented an article called ``Tangible Bits: Towards Seamless Interfaces between People, Bits and Atoms''. They established the term ``Tangible User Interface'' (TUI) as a way to move beyond the dominant model of Graphical User Interfaces. The objective of TUI was explained to \emph{augment the real physical world by coupling digital information to everyday physical objects and environments} \cite{ishii1997tangible}. Thus, TUIs are all about giving physical objects a digital meaning.   


In our case, a Karotz is an example of a tangible user interface. It lets the user interact with a rabbit instead of a desktop or tablet, which contains digital information about whether it is time to take medicine, and can send digital messages to notify our database that a child has taken their medicine.      


\section{Effects of robots}

In 2003, Wada et. al. conducted a study on how robotics affected elderly \cite{wada2004effects}. They conducted a study at a day service center in Japan, where they placed a robotic seal, named Paro, together with the elderly. The argument supporting this study was that it has been found that animals have a positive effects on blood preassure, depression and loneliness. (Omskriving?). The problems is that animals are not allowed in a lot of hosiptals and care centers, because people may have allergic reactions or get scratch marks from it. They placed a robotic seal in the care center, and anylzed the reactions from the elderly. 

The results showed that their mood was better after interacting with Paro in five weeks, and became worse once Paro was no longer there. In addition, nurses burnout rate decreased during the experiment, which implies that they had easier days whenever Paro was there.
