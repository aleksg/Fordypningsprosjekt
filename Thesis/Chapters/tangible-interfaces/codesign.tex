\section{Co-design}
This section will describe co-design and how we plan to use a co-design approach when developing our TUI.

\subsection{What is co-design?}
Co-design is a product, service, or organization development process where design professionals empower, encourage, and guide users to develop solutions for themselves. Co-design encourages the blurring of the role between user and designer, focusing on the process by which the design objective is created \cite{sanders2008co}. By encouraging the trained designer and the end user to create ideas and solutions together, the final result will be more appropriate and acceptable to the end user \cite{albinsson2007co}. 
Albinsson et al \cite{albinsson2007co} discovered that having a co-design approach to development of a e-mail sorting system lead to the ability of easier conflict management, ability to centre innovation on the client/customer and made it easier to manage a project with an unknown outcome. While co-design has been around for over 40 years, it draws it's roots from user-centered design and participatory design. Co-design differs from user-centered design approaches in that it acknowledges that the client or beneficiary of the design may not be using the artifact itself \cite{norman1986user}.



\subsection{Using co-design to build AsthmaBuddy}
Based on the research we have read, and recommendation from domain experts, we have chosen to try a co-design approach to develop our TUI; AsthmaBuddy. We will build a low-fidelity prototype which we can show to a group of test persons and domain experts. These sessions will take place at a usability lab in order to make sure we record all answers we get during the sessions. A session will consist of us showing the functionality and design of the current prototype, a test where the test persons may use the prototype in order to get to know it better and an interview/brainstorming where the test persons may give feedback. In order to achieve useful feedback we will answer the questions stated in Table \ref{tab:tuidesign} beforehand, thus limiting the options of the participants to a reasonable level. 


Based on the feedback and ideas from the co-design session we will build a new prototype which we will bring back to the next co-design session. These sessions will be arranged at regular short intervals, so we may get much feedback and ensure that we do not go off track when developing AsthmaBuddy.
