	\hline
	\textbf{Mechanism} & \textbf{Included in AsthmAPP} & \textbf{Rationale} \\
	\hline
	Avatar systems & No & We did not have time to implement this during our thesis, but we do believe this could be a good feature if it was implemented in a right manner.    
	 \\
	\hline
	Achievements and badges & No & We believe our target group would not enjoy this feature as much as older children, those of 12 - 16 years of age.  \\
	\hline 
	Real-World awards & Yes & Children enjoy the feeling of being rewarded with something real.
	 \\
	\hline
	Mirroring user behavior & Yes & Demonstration has a positive effect on children.
	\\
	\hline
	Leaderboards & No & There are no way to implement this in a realistic and legal way. Children would have to share their data, which consists of points based on medicine doses. Parents could be blamed if their child were on the bottom of the list. It would also be negative for small children's motivation if they have been really good at taking their medicine, and perform poorly on a leaderboard. 
	\\
	\hline
	Social networking & No & Much of the same reasons as why we did not choose leaderboards. We also believe that children in our target group would not understand this aspect.  
	\\
	\hline
	Progress bar & No & In an ideal world, we could have shown how close the child was to becoming fully treated for asthma. However, identifying how close a patient is to becoming healthy, is virtually impossible. Another usage may be to match the child's progress for each week against his/her medicine plan. This would however, imply that by-need treatments would not be included, which may seem unfair for the child. Additionally, their progress would be deleted every week, which would not have much motivational effect.  
	\\
	\hline
	Experience points & Yes & The stars will work as experience points, which may used to cash in rewards from the parents. 
	\\
	\hline
	Contests & No & Using medical history to participate in contests would be a violation of Norwegian privacy laws. It may also be used to pinpoint ``bad'' parents.
