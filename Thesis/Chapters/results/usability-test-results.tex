\section{Usability Test Results}
\label{sec:usabilityresults}
In order to protect the identity of our test subjects, especially considering the children, we have used identifiers as names. Names starting with the letter ``A'' is an adult user, and names starting with ``C'' denotes a child.

\textbf{Comments about the test}

The execution of this user test unfortunately suffered from a mistake made before initiating the test. When we started it, the Android device were not connected to the network. As such, task 2 uncovered a bug that we had never seen before. In order to get any useful testing started, we had to reset the application and connect it to the network, before we started over again. The first impression was probably not the best.   


\subsection{Child Partition}

During the user tests, \ab{} was configured to use the varied interaction scheme. This involved a preset combination of the remaining interactions from Table \ref{tab:interactioneval}. This decision was made in order to test all of the possible interactions, as we did not have enough users to test them one-by-one.

\textbf{Comments about the test}

CU1 was very shy when arriving at the test lab. It quickly became clear for us that we had to leave the area and rather observe from the back room, in order for her to speak up. The parent was instructed with the tasks that were to be performed, and he explained the tasks to her. Once we were back stage, she started responding to the instructions given. We made a note that the observer should sit in the back room and observe from there, in order for the children to respond more easily.   

When asked which method CU1 preferred, i.e. \app{} or \ab{}, CU1 replied ``I don't know''. CU1 was also asked if both were equally fun, which to CU1 replied ``Yes''. CU1 was also asked if the usage of \app{} and \ab{} was more fun than a regular treatment, which to CU replied ``Yes''\footnote{There is reason to believe that the answer was biased due to the reward}. We asked if this was because of her reward, which was candy, but we were unable to get a reply.

\textbf{Comments about the test}

When asked about which system he liked the most, CU2 first replied that he liked both systems equally. When we ``pushed'' him to pick one, he thought that \ab{} was more fun to interact with, as it had lights that blinked. He also liked \app{}, as it contained the store where he could buy a reward.

\textbf{Comments about the test}

When asked about which system he liked the most, CU3 switched back and forth between the \app{} and both. After analyzing the recordings, we found strong reason to believe that he had most fun when using \app{}. 

A problem not mentioned in Table \ref{tab:testchild3}, was that he was not able to read the text when he was to buy a reward. We have put a lot of effort into minimizing the reading ability required from the children, but at a certain point, some text is in required. An option for reducing the reading capabilities required at this stage, could be to prerecord potential rewards, but  it required too much resources to do this. An image of the view had problems with is included in Figure [TODO].
