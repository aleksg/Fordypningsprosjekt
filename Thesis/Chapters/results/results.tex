\section{Interviews}
\label{sec:interviewresults}

We performed interviews on a set of domain experts in order to receive input on the work we had accomplished. Table \ref{tab:interviewsperformed} summarizes the interviews we performed, why we interviewed these subjects and the topics we covered during the interviews. Transcripts from the interviews are included in Appendix \ref{app:interview-transcripts}. 

Where we have interviewed parents of children with asthma, we have named those Parent N (N is a number), in order to protect the identity of their children.

\subsection{Discoveries Found During Interviews}

\textbf{Operating time}

The longest duration for taking a planned treatment was about 2 minutes for an experienced user, and about 2.5 minutes for an inexperienced user. This treatment included the part where \buddy{} completes the treatment before the child. A normal treatment taken without \ab{} usually takes 1 - 2 minutes, according to our interview subjects. Since \ab{} only takes 0.5 - 1.5 minutes longer than normal, it should not be considered a time-waster. From another point-of-view, if a child does not want to take his/her medication, it may cause an argument and it may take a much longer time to complete the treatment. If \ab{} can help on shortening the time spent arguing with the child, time may be saved.      

\clearpage{}
\textbf{By need treatments}

We got some feedback regarding the \emph{by need} treatments. Some parents stated that they would not use \buddy{} to complete a by need treatment, as their child was suffering from an asthma attack. However, one of the parents noted that if children were used to performing their treatment with \buddy{}, it could create a dependency toward it, i.e. \buddy{} could help the parents to calm the child. Whether or not the by need functionality would actually be used needs more research, as \buddy{} would need to be placed within a home and be nearby when such an attack occurs. 

\textbf{\ab{} as a stand-alone system}

One of the interview subjects commented that \ab{} should be able to operate as a stand-alone system if the parents do not allow the child to borrow a smartphone and the child does not have a smartphone of his/her own. The same interview subject commented that she would not take the time to use \ab{} for two minutes every time the child needed to take a treatment, and that \ab{} might become boring after a period of time.

\textbf{Feedback on gamification system}

Nanna S. Kayed noted that letting parents choose when and what children should receive as rewards was good, but comes with a downside: If the parents do not have an understanding as to how fast a child needs his/her reward, the child could easily loose interest. The amount of time necessary between each reward is highly individual. Preschoolers would need rewards almost every day, while older children could manage with a reward twice a week. The part that is somewhat hard to understand from a parent's perspective, is that children needs to know they are rewarded for a treatment well done, and not necessarily something completely different. She proposed that if an application like this should be launched, a parental guide should follow along, as parents often do not understand this principle.

Furthermore, there has to be a balance between the rewards a child receives, and the work they are actually doing. For instance, a child cannot receive a bike after completing three treatments. Parents also have a materialistic mindset, i.e. parents think that rewards have to be something material. Kayed implied otherwise. Letting children choose a dinner, which TV program to watch at nighttime, or even being allowed to eat their breakfast under the table could be just as effective and fun as giving them materialistic rewards. In order to equalize rewards across families, she concluded that parents already do this in other ``domains'', like allowance.   

\section{Testing \ab{} on Inexperienced Users}
\label{chp:interaction-methods}

Before we did user tests on children, we ran a round of tests to verify \ab{}'s ability to explain the treatment process for inexperienced users. We tested on ten students at NTNU, where one of them had had asthma during childhood. While doing so, we also tested the different interaction methods \ab{} could be used with. The reason we wanted to test the interaction methods was to get an overview of how adults perceived the interactions. If adult users are incapable of doing some of the interaction methods, we figured that children were probably incapable of doing the same. Additionally, since we had problems to get a significant amount of children to test the system on (which will be elaborated further in Chapter \ref{sec:difficultyfindingtestusers}), we did not want to waste a usability test on a child by initially having a bad interaction design.         

The results of the interaction testing is summarized in table \ref{tab:interactioneval}.

\begin{tabular}{|p{3.5cm} | p{7.6cm} | p{2.2cm} |}
\hline 
\textbf{Interaction Method} & \textbf{Comments} & \textbf{Suitable for children?}\\
\hline
	Give AsthmaBuddy a ``High Five'' & Worked out fine. A high five is cool and may make \ab{} seem more friendly to the children. & Yes \\
\hline
	Hold AsthmaBuddy's hand & Easy to understand and use during a treatment. Should give feedback to indicate that the user has interacted correctly. & Yes\\
\hline
	Hold smartphone close to AsthmaBuddy's belly & Smartphones are cool, but may be easily damaged if dropped. Too risky to let small children handle a smartphone. The size of the smartphone may require use of two hands, which may cause complications for the child. & No \\
\hline
	Press AsthmaBuddy's nose & Users tended to press the LED light on the nose. Risk of damage to light. & No\\
\hline
	Press \buddy{}'s belly & Easy to understand and use during a treatment. Should give feedback to indicate that the user has interacted correctly. & Yes\\
\hline
	Hold medicine close to AsthmaBuddy's mouth & Created some complications when the user was supposed to hold the breathing chamber to his/her mouth and then hold the medicine close to \ab{}'s mouth to proceed. & No \\
\hline
	Hold RFID-chip close to \buddy{}'s nose & The thickness of \buddy{}'s nose made it difficult for the RFID tag to communicate with our reader, this caused problems for the user. & No \\
\hline
	Hold RFID-chip close to \buddy{}'s belly & Works fine. Letting children have their ``magic token'' which interacts with \ab{} may be considered cool. & Yes\\
\hline
	Clap your hands & Works fine. At one point the user has to clap hands when having the breathing chamber in his/her hands, which may cause some problems, but should not be a big problem. & Yes\\
\hline
	A variation of the above interactions & Some of the interaction methods made it confusing for the user, e.g. they were asked to hold the medicine towards \ab{} before having fetched the medicine. & Yes, but in a revised form.\\

\subsection{Observations Made During Tests}

In order for \ab{} to be useful for inexperienced users, it could have even clearer and more informative instructions. Even though it may seem self-explanatory to take the cap off the medicine before mounting it on the breathing chamber, it may not be that obvious to new users. Since \ab{}'s purpose is to instruct and inform, it should have a completely ``foolproof'' instructions. For instance some of the test users tried to attach the inhaler to the breathing chamber without removing the protective cap from the inhaler. Since the breathing chamber's mount is made from rubber, it gave them the idea that one should just push the medicine into the mount by force, which is incorrect. 

When using \ab{}, some users found it difficult to hear all of the instructions. Supporting replay of the last instruction was important.

\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{\ab{}}

After completing all of the validation tests, it occured to us that not one out of the three children we tested \ab{} with were able to listen to \emph{every} instruction and interact accordingly. I.e. every user had to make use of the repeat functionality. There is reason to believe that this is a problem caused by the speed \ab{} talks in. It seemed like a somewhat hard task for children to keep up with both the instruction, e.g. ``Shake the blue medicine, and attach it to your mask'', and the interaction that was to performed, e.g. ``Clap your hands to proceed''. 

As mentioned, CU3 discovered that \ab{} was not stable enough to handle a proper high five. This problem would probably have been avoided if the child had gotten used to interacting with \ab{}, giving him more knowledge of which preventive measures that needs to be taken, e.g. supporting his back while giving him the high five. However, a more valid argument is that the choice we made regarding \ab{} as a teddy bear was not ideal in the first place.  

Overall, it seemed like all of the children were able to interact with \ab{} as intended. Additionally, it seemed like all of the children found \ab{} enjoyable. 

\subsection{\app{}}

During the user test on AU2, we discovered a critical error that almost rendered the application completely useless. The error originates from the fact that \app{} needs to communicate with the database, and we had not implemented proper feedback to the user that an error had occured. This error should obviously not have occured in the first place, as these types of errors will result in less incentive for parents to use \app{}. 

As for the children, it seemed like all of them liked to use \app{}. However, with the low sample size and bearing in mind the fact that it was children we tested, there is reason to question the validity of this result. On one hand, none of the children had big problems to do what \app{} told them to do and had very few problems navigating the application. On the other hand, the only child able to read was CU2, who is seven years old. More effort should have been made to make the process of purchasing a reward even clear for the youngest users of our target group.     

As far as the gamification system goes, it seemed like children were happy with the fact that stars appear immediately after the treatment was finished. They also seemed happy with the rewards they were given. However, a question that remains unanswered is whether our approach to a gamification system is sustainable over a longer period of time.
