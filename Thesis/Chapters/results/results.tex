\section{Interviews}
\label{sec:interviewresults}

We performed interviews on a set of domain experts in order to receive input on the work we had accomplished. Table \ref{tab:interviewsperformed} summarizes the interviews we performed, why we interviewed these subjects and the topics we covered during the interviews. Transcripts from the interviews are included in Appendix \ref{app:interview-transcripts}. 


Where we have interviewed parents of children with asthma, we have named those Parent N (N is a number), in order to protect the identity of their children.

\section{Testing \ab{} on Inexperienced Users}
\label{chp:interaction-methods}

Before we did user tests on children, we ran a round of tests to verify \ab{}'s ability to explain the treatment process for inexperienced users. We tested on ten students at NTNU, where one of them had asthma during childhood. While doing so, we also tested the different interaction methods \ab{} could be used with. The reason we wanted to test interaction methods was to get an overview of how adults perceived the interactions. If adult users are incapable of doing some of the interaction methods, we figured that children were probably incapable of doing the same. Additionally, since we had problems to get a significant amount of children to test the system on (which will be elaborated further in Chapter \ref{sec:difficultyfindingtestusers}), we did not want to waste a usability test on a child by initially having a bad interaction design.         

The results of the interaction testing is summarized in table \ref{tab:interactioneval}.  

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{|p{4.0cm} | p{7.5cm} | p{2.5cm} |}
\hline 
\textbf{Interaction Method} & \textbf{Comments} & \textbf{Suitable for children?}\\
\hline
	Give AsthmaBuddy a ``High Five'' & Worked out fine. A high five is cool and may make \ab{} seem more friendly to the children. & Yes \\
\hline
	Hold AsthmaBuddy's hand & Easy to understand and use during a treatment. Should give feedback to indicate that the user has interacted correctly. & Yes\\
\hline
	Hold smartphone close to AsthmaBuddy's belly & Smart phones are cool, but may be easily damaged if dropped. To risky to let small children handle a smartphone. The size of the smartphone may require use of two hands, which may cause complications for the child. & No \\
\hline
	Press AsthmaBuddy's nose & Users tended to press the LED light on the nose. Risk of damage to light. & No\\
\hline
	Press \buddy{}'s belly & Easy to understand and use during a treatment. Should give feedback to indicate that the user has interacted correctly. & Yes\\
\hline
	Hold medicine close to AsthmaBuddy's mouth & Created some complications when the user was supposed to hold the mask to his/her mouth and then hold the medicine close to \ab{}'s mouth to proceed. & No \\
\hline
	Hold RFID-chip close to \buddy{}'s nose & The thickness of \buddy{}'s nose made it difficult for the RFID tag to communicate with our reader, this caused problems for the user. & No \\
\hline
	Hold RFID-chip close to \buddy{}'s belly & Works OK. Letting children have their ``magic token'' which interacts with \ab{} may be cool for them. & Yes\\
\hline
	Clap your hands & Worked out OK. At one point the user has to clap hands when having the mask in his/her hands, which may cause some problems, but should not be a big problem. & Yes\\
\hline
	A variation of the above interactions & Confusing for users. The confusion may take the fun out of it. & May be considered in a revised form.\\

\paragraph{Operating time}

The longest duration for taking a planned treatment was about 2 minutes for an experienced user, and about 2.5 minutes for an inexperienced user. This treatment included the part where \buddy{} completes the treatment before the child. A normal treatment taken without \ab{} usually takes 1-2 minutes, according to our interview subjects. Since \ab{} only takes 0.5-1.5 minutes longer than normal, it should not be considered a time-waster. From another point-of-view, if a child does not want to take his/her medication, it may cause an argument and take more time to complete the treatment. If \ab{} can help on shortening the time spent arguing with the child, a large amount of time may be saved.      

\paragraph{Feedback}

We got some feedback regarding the \emph{by need} treatments. Some parents stated that they would not use \buddy{} to complete a by need treatment, as their child was suffering from an asthma attack. However, one of the parents noted that if children were used to performing their treatment with \buddy{}, it could create a dependency toward it, i.e. \buddy{} could help the child to calm down. Whether or not the by need functionality would actually be used needs more research, as \buddy{} would need to be placed within a home and be nearby when such an attack occurs. 

In order for \ab{} to be useful for inexperienced users, it could have even clearer and more informative instructions. Even though it may seem self-explanatory to take the cap off the medicine before mounting it on the mask, it may not be that obvious to new users. Since \ab{}'s purpose is to instruct and inform, it should have a completely ``foolproof'' instructions. For instance some of the test users tried to attach the inhaler to the mask without removing the protective cap from the inhaler. Since the mask's mount is made from rubber, it gave them the idea that one should just push the medicine into the mount by force, which is incorrect. 

When using \ab{} it may sometimes be difficult to hear all the instructions. There should be support for replay of the latest command.

One of the users commented that \ab{} should be able to operate as a stand-alone system if the parents do not allow the child to borrow a smartphone and the child does not have a smartphone of his/her own. The same test user commented that she would not take the time to use \ab{} for two minutes every time the child needed to take a treatment, and that \ab{} might become boring after a period of time.
