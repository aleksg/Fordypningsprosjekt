\section{Gamification}
\label{sec:gamificationresults}

\subsection{Understanding Childrens Need for Rewards}

Our solution to gamification is highly coupled with parents' initiative. In order for our reward system to have any motivational effect, parents has to be highly involved. They need to understand how often their child needs a reward, in addition to understanding what defines a ``good'' reward for their children. 

Webster-Stratton and Herbert claims:

\textit{Preschool children aged between the ages of three and four may be rewarded by the special sticker or token itself without needing a back-up reinforcer. Youngsters aged four to six should be able to trade in stickers for something each day if they like. Children of seven and eight can wait a few days before getting a reward. } \cite{webster1994troubled}

In order for our AsthmAPP and AsthmaBuddy to be a motivational success, parents have to be aware over their children's maturity. They need to understand the above statement, and use this for their own children. 

\subsection{Bartle's Four Player Types}
In Section \ref{sec:bartlesplayertypes} we presented Bartle's four player types and how they enjoy gamification. In order to understand how gamification can be used to motivate children with asthma, we have looked for solutions for how to build an enjoyable gamification system for the four players types, achievers, explorers, killers and socializers. 

In Section \ref{sec:killers} we stated that hopefully no children in our target group hope to gamify their experience by imposing themselves on others. We found no positive and meaningful way to support ``killers'' in our system, and some of the scenarios proposed were even horrifying. 

While AsthmAPP has little support for socializers, we believe there is potential for use of social features in a system such as AsthmAPP. An example of such would be the use of an avatar system where the children may share their avatar with others and meet other users of AsthmAPP in a social hub similar to Club Penguin\fnurl{Club Penguin}{www.clubpenguin.com} or \fnurl{Farmville}{www.farmville.com}. 
\iref{} [Is this positive? Can it cause jealousy?]

AsthmAPP is a concept and has little to explore, however, we believe that there is a potential for functionality to motivate explorers. The use of progress bars, leveling systems or achievements and badges can easily be transferred to a system like AsthmAPP in order to achieve a gamified experience targeted at explorers. Linander's interactive story concept\cite{linander2013utvikling} showed how the progress in a story may be tied to the use of asthma medicine. Having such stories would engaging for children, and possibilities for adding new stories over time would create a more engaging system for children. 

AsthmAPP has the most support for achievers. The gamification system in \app{} is built around performing a treatment correctly and being awarded for doing so. The use of experience points in terms of stars and support for real-world rewards in terms of the shop in the app is systems applicable for all children, but may be of most interest to achievers. There is endless potential for how gamification may be used to engage achievers, and there are many possibilities for further research on these areas.

\section{Tangible Interfaces}
\label{sec:resultstui}
During our project we discovered different areas where tangible user interfaces may be of use for asthmatic children, their parents and other caregivers. The main areas include learning, motivating, distracting and informing. Other areas where TUIs could be of use is elaborated on in Section \ref{sec:otheraspects}.


\subsection{TUI as a Tool for Learning}

When a child gets diagnosed with asthma, their parents receive a lot of information at the doctors office. It happens that parents are not paying attention, does not understand the information received, or do not communicate the information correctly to other caregivers. As two asthma nurses stated in an interview: 

\textit{``We always make sure to teach the parents and the children how to apply the medication correctly, however, they may forget it over time. If the parents do not remember how and when to give the children medications, it may have a negative effect on the treatment of the child's asthma.''}
[Wait for quote checking]

\buddy{} can be used to relieve parents from the responsibility of remembering exactly how and when the medicine should be taken. Parents will probably remember the process after a couple of days, but \buddy{} could help them with the start up. 

Hospitals hand out flyers and treatment schemes to parents when children are diagnosed with asthma. However, flyers are often lost, and miscommunication often happens when parents leave their child with other caregivers, like grandparents, babysitter, etc. By sending the child off together with \buddy{}, the implications of any miscommunication could be minimized.    

In addition to teaching parents about asthma, \buddy{} could be used to teach children about their disease. In some cases, parents don't explain to their children why they are sick, and what is causing their breathing problems. After a child has taken a dosage, \buddy{} could proceed to read a book about asthma, specifically written for children. As more treatments have gone by, new chapters can be read, increasing children's knowledge and awareness about their disease.   

When informing children and parents about asthma, it is vital that they receive the correct information. If the information provided contain errors, it could have big consequences for the asthma treatment. The information provided should be approved by either medical doctors or organizations like the NAAF. This will provide as a quality assurance, in addition to gaining potential families' trust.    

\textit{``Children below your target group (i.e. younger than 3 years old) can be even harder to motivate, as children in the group 3- 5 years old has an understanding as to why they need to take their medicine.''}
Children in the age of 3-5 years old understands that they get better from taking their medicine. However, few parents actually tells them specifically what is wrong with them [Sitat?]. \buddy{} could have been used to inform children about what happens with their lungs before and after they take their medicine.

\subsection{TUI as a Tool for Motivating}


\subsection{TUI as a Tool for Distracting} 


\subsection{TUI as a Tool for Informing}
For children with astma there is a lot to remember. We have already discussed the theme of learning about asthma, which is a very important aspect. There is still more to remember, and we have found some ideas for what the tangible user interface may help for. 

\paragraph{Counting doses left in the inhaler}
One of the interviewees noted that: 

\textit{``It is annoying when medicines go empty, so we're keeping a journal''}

Since the inhalers have a certain amount of doses in them, and the amount of doses varies between different medicines and their vendors, it may require an effort to remember how many doses are left. The disk-formed medicine often come with an indicator, while inhalers do not. Inhalers make a ``poof'' sound when pressed, and this sound may occur regardless of whether or not there are any doses left. By using a RFID on the medicine and a RFID-reader on the TUI, you may keep up with how many doses have been taken, and automatically warn the user when the amount of doses is running low. There are many other ways to solve this digitally, but we believe that having \buddy{} count how many doses you have left and be able to tell the user by sound could be fun for children and helpful for parents.

\paragraph{Pollution levels and pollen forecast}
There are many different applications and web pages for reading and recieving information about air quality and pollen forecast. These web sites often offer relaying data to third party services. AsthmAPP has the functionality for getting air quality readings and pollen forecast in the same application (see Section \ref{sec:description-medicine-log}).
\buddy{} could help the children with the same functionality, starting the day by telling how the air quality and pollen readings are for the day. 

In a future version, \buddy{} could calculate and foresee the amount of medicine needed when there is much pollen or bad air quality and update its alarm schedule based on the knowledge gathered. However, this is a functionality which will require research and we do not have the knowledge to judge if this is possible to implement or wether or not is useful for the users. 


\paragraph{Reminders}
\buddy{} has functionality for firing alarms based on the treatment plan set in AsthmAPP. This makes it easier for the children and parents to remember to apply the treatment at the planned time. While taking medicine is often a routine for families with asthmatic children, \buddy{} could be a useful embodyment of a reminder. 

In a future version \buddy{} should be able to know that if a treatment has been completed within a short time before a planned treatment, the planned treatment will not be necessary. For a user having done their planned treatment, an alarm firing 5 minutes later can be annoying. \buddy{}'s purpose is to help the user to remember, and if the user has already completed the treatment, \ab{} should be satisfied. 

\section{Other Aspects}
\label{sec:otheraspects}
During the project we discovered different areas where \ab{} could be of use, some of these did not sort under the topics learning, motivating, distracting and informing. These findings are presented in this section.

\subsection{Helping Kindergartens, Schools and Caregivers}
During our interviews, we discovered a potential problem when children are in the kindergarten or at pre-school. It may occur that the caregivers don't know how to handle an asthma attack properly. According to one of our interview subjects: 

\textit{``The biggest problem is that the teachers/kindergarten teacher may not have knowledge of what to do when an asthma attack occurs. An application with instructions may be of help to them.''}

A solution to this problem was provided by a kindergarten teacher we interviewed, who said that it was hard to keep track of which child was supposed to take his/her medicine at the correct time. They sometimes had this information stored on their own phone, or had a note in their pocket. In some cases, no such tool were used, which relies heavily on the teachers' memory. If the teacher forgets it, there is a possibility that the child don't take their medicine properly at the given day. 
The kindergarten teacher proposed an application that allowed parents to register a medicine that was to be taken, and sent push notifications to the teachers, that could remind them of their child's need for a treatment. We concluded that this functionality is out of the scope in this thesis, but we found the idea interesting.         

From our viewpoint, having a shared \buddy{} in a kindergarten could lead to complexity and problems. First, \buddy{} would have to learn the names of the children in order to keep track of children whose turn it is. Second, there could be no overlapping of treatments, which might become inefficient (depending on the teachers). Third, having a shared \buddy{} in a kindergarten could easily be destroyed. If placed in a kindergarten, \buddy{} in it's current state would probably cause more problems rather than helping the kindergarten teachers. With changes and modifications, we still see the use for tangible interfaces in kindergartens and preschools, as a useful tool to help teachers and children.    



\subsection{Tangible Interfaces to Help Parents Help Children}
When children suffers from asthma, they often have to rely on their parents in order to maintain control of their disease. Parents have to maintain a clean house and they have to keep an eye on pollen, as pollen and asthma often are related. One of the features \buddy{} could have in order to help parents is a morning cast, informing parents about the weather, pollen distributions and air quality. 

In the future, \buddy{} could communicate with dust sensors, that could indicate whether or not parents actually needed to clean the house. Additionally, \buddy{} could communicate with a Roomba \fnurl{iRobot Roomba}{http://www.irobot.com/us/}, which in turn could start cleaning. \buddy{} could also indicate the air humidity at the child room, starting up the air condition.

\subsection{Do's and Don'ts when Using a TUI}

\paragraph{Mobility}
When developing a TUI for children it is important that the TUI is mobile. Children become attached to their toys and like to take them with them. To make the most out of a tool such as \buddy{} it is important that the children may take it with them. The problem of power usage may be solved by a battery. The problem of recharging can be solved by charging at nights. 

\paragraph{Use of colored lights}
With \buddy{} we tried the use of LED lights to make \buddy{} more interesting than a normal teddy bear. During a treatment the LED light would indicate which medicine was supposed to be taken, by beaming lights in the same color, blink to count the seconds when breathing and using red light to indicate the seriousness of having to find an adult to overview the process.

One of our interview subjects, a PhD candidate of product design stated in an interview: 
\textit{``People's perception of and preference for sensory stimuli differs. The use of lights and sound may affect the children in different ways, but that will have to be explored in user studies.''} 

We believe this is a complete field of research on it's own. There already exists some research, such as M\ae hlum's concept for increased user acceptability when treating children with respiratory infections\cite{mahlum2013}, and we have not done enough research to draw conclusions on the use of colored lights during treatments. 


\paragraph{Interaction Methods}
\buddy{} in it's prototype form was not able to sense interaction, and was operated by using a ``Wizard-of-Oz technique''\cite{wilson1988rapid}. \buddy{} was not able to give feedback that the user did interaction correctly. The only form of confirmation was that the next sound clip would start playing. This may lead to confusion and uncertainties among users as to whether they interact correctly. \iref{}
