\chapter{Discussion and Conclusions}
\label{chp:masterconclusion}

This chapter completes the discussion chapter by representing the research questions, providing answers where possible, and evaluates the process of obtaining these answers.

\section{Process Evaluation}
\label{sec:processevaluation}
As with all other software development projects, the development of AsthmAPP and AsthmaBuddy has hit some bumps in the road. This chapter will look into possible improvements of the developments process. Second it will evaluate the experiment design and point out different elements which could have been done differently.

\subsection{Difficulty Finding Test Users}
\label{sec:difficultyfindingtestusers}
When performing user tests and interviews involving gathering personal medical information, there are several requirements to be met. Firstly, the research project must be evaluated by an ethical committee\fnurl{Regional Etisk Komit√©}{https://helseforskning.etikkom.no/ikbViewer/page/forside?_ikbLanguageCode=n}, and while the paperwork have easy-to-follow standards, this took some time\footnote{Our project was authorized in January 2014, under case number 2012/159}. 

Secondly started the hunt for potential test persons. We contacted different hospitals and with persons with expertise on asthma. We asked them to help us recruit test persons for our project. In order for the hospitals to help us, we needed an approval from their marketing/ethical committee. In our efforts we were a bit unlucky. After applying for an approval, we did not hear from the hospital in a while. After numerous phone calls and e-mails, we got the answer that the person responsible for our processing our application had been on sick leave for a long period of time. In hindsight we understand that this process should have started some months before the actual project, in order to allow for such unforeseen events. 

In parallell to the contact with hospitals and doctors we tried recruiting test persons through friends, colleagues, social media and mailing lists from NTNU and local organizations. This proved less fruitful than we hoped. We have no concrete feedback as to why we had so little response, but we have our assumptions. Firstly the user group is a very specific group, there might not be that many children living in Trondheim at the age of 3 - 7 years, suffering from asthma. Secondly people tend to not care if they do not get a reward for helping, and since we had little to offer in terms of economical compensation or rewards, the interest might have withered away for some people. Thirdly, there may have been scepticism from the potential test users. While all the different paperwork was in order and the project may prove positive for the children and parents within the target group, the fact that we are two students writing a master thesis may be less encouraging.


\subsection{Co-Design Sessions}
\label{sec:codesignsessionsdifficulties}
Our original plan was to arrange co-design sessions with several experts present at the same time. We believe this would have helped the creativity of the feedback for \app{} and \ab{}. However, this proved too difficult to arrange. The persons we wanted to invite were very busy and after several failed attempts to find a time suitable for all experts, we gave up trying to arrange co-design sessions. 

  
\section{Conclusions}
