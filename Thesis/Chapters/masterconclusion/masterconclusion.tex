\chapter{Discussion and Conclusions}
\label{chp:masterconclusion}

This chapter completes the discussion chapter by representing the research questions, providing answers where possible, and evaluates the process of obtaining these answers.

\section{Process Evaluation}
\label{sec:processevaluation}
As with all other software development projects, the development of AsthmAPP and AsthmaBuddy has hit some bumps in the road. This chapter will look into possible improvements of the developments process. Second it will evaluate the experiment design and point out different elements which could have been done differently.

\subsection{Difficulty Finding Test Users}
\label{sec:difficultyfindingtestusers}
When performing user tests and interviews involving gathering personal medical information, there are requirements to be followed. Before contacting potential test users, the research project must be evaluated by an ethical committee\fnurl{Regional Etisk Komite}{https://helseforskning.etikkom.no/ikbViewer/page/forside?\_ikbLanguageCode=n}, and while the paperwork have easy-to-follow standards, this took some time\footnote{Our project was authorized in January 2014, under case number 2012/159}. 

The hunt for potential test users proved more difficult than anticipated. We contacted different hospitals and persons with expertise on asthma. We asked them to help us recruit test persons for our project. In order for the hospitals to help us, we needed an approval from their marketing/ethical committee. In our efforts we were a bit unlucky. After applying for an approval, we did not hear from the hospital in a while. After numerous phone calls and e-mails, we got the answer that the person responsible for our processing our application had been on sick leave for a long period of time. In hindsight we understand that this process should have started some months before the actual project, in order to allow for such unforeseen events. 

In parallell to the contact with hospitals and doctors we tried recruiting test persons through friends, colleagues, social media and mailing lists from NTNU and local organizations. This proved less fruitful than we hoped. We have no concrete feedback as to why we had so little response, but we have our assumptions. Firstly, the user group is a very specific group. There might not be that many children living in Trondheim at the age of 3 - 7 years, suffering from asthma, who also have parents willing to participate in our research. Secondly, people tend to not care if they do not get an attractive reward for helping, and since we had little to offer in terms of economical compensation or rewards, the interest might have withered away for some people. Thirdly, there may have been scepticism from the potential test users. While all the different paperwork was in order and the project may prove positive for the children and parents within the target group, the fact that we are two students writing a master thesis may be less encouraging\footnote{We \emph{belive} that if the researchers were publicly acknowledged, it would have been a bit easier to recruit users}.


\subsection{Co-Design Sessions}
\label{sec:codesignsessionsdifficulties}
Our original plan was to arrange co-design sessions with several experts present at the same time. We believe this would have helped the creativity of the feedback for \app{} and \ab{}. However, this proved too difficult to arrange. The persons we wanted to invite were very busy and after several failed attempts to find a time suitable for all experts, we gave up trying to arrange co-design sessions. 

  
\section{Conclusions}
\label{conlusions}

The research questions presented in Chapter \ref{sec:researchquestions} provides a basis for summarization of results discussed in Chapter \ref{chp:results}.

\paragraph{RQ2: How can Tangible Interfaces be used for motivating children to take their asthma medicine?}


\section{Validity of our Results}

\textbf{Sample Size}

\textbf{Interview transcripts}


\textbf{Testing environment and Equipment}
The testing lab at NSEP has little similiarities to a home, where the user will normally use \ab{} or \app{}. The lab is situated within a hospital building, which again is next door to the child clinic of the hospital. This may have intimidated our users and placed them in a situation they were not comfortable with. 

During the user tests we used placebo medicine, which contains compressed air instead of medication. The users were told this very clearly before the test started. Since users of asthma medicine is adviced to not overdose on medication, this was important to tell the users. Even though the users were told very clearly that the medicine had no effect, one of the users did not want to take the medicine, and asked if it was okay if the container was not pressed, so the particles were not released into the breathing chamber. 
We also used masks that we brought with us. The fact that the masks differed from the masks the users have at home may have made them insecure or intimidated. This may have biased the outcome of the user test. 


\textbf{Time period}
A central aspect to gamification is whether it will work over a longer period of time. While we have discussed \app{}'s gamification system and how it makes it own spin on gamification by being so user-centric, we have not researched how the user reacts over time. Preferrably we would have done user testing over a period of time, in order to receive feedback on how the children reacted to using the gamification system over a week, a month, several months. 

The lack of testing over periods of time is a threat to the conclusions regarding the use of gamification.
