\chapter{Discussion and Conclusions}
\label{chp:masterconclusion}

This chapter completes the discussion chapter by representing the research questions, providing answers where possible, and evaluates the process of obtaining these answers.

\section{Process Evaluation}
\label{sec:processevaluation}
As with all other software development projects, the development of AsthmAPP and AsthmaBuddy has hit some bumps in the road. This chapter will look into possible improvements of the developments process. Second it will evaluate the experiment design and point out different elements which could have been done differently.

\subsection{Difficulty Finding Test Users}
\label{sec:difficultyfindingtestusers}
When performing user tests and interviews involving gathering personal medical information, there are requirements to be followed. Before contacting potential test users, the research project must be evaluated by an ethical committee\fnurl{Regional Etisk Komite}{https://helseforskning.etikkom.no/ikbViewer/page/forside?\_ikbLanguageCode=n}, and while the paperwork have easy-to-follow standards, this took some time\footnote{Our project was authorized in January 2014, under case number 2012/159}. 

The hunt for potential test users proved more difficult than anticipated. We contacted different hospitals and persons with expertise on asthma. We asked them to help us recruit test persons for our project. In order for the hospitals to help us, we needed an approval from their marketing/ethical committee. In our efforts we were a bit unlucky. After applying for an approval, we did not hear from the hospital in a while. After numerous phone calls and e-mails, we got the answer that the person responsible for our processing our application had been on sick leave for a long period of time. In hindsight we understand that this process should have started some months before the actual project, in order to allow for such unforeseen events. 

In parallell to the contact with hospitals and doctors we tried recruiting test persons through friends, colleagues, social media and mailing lists from NTNU and local organizations. This proved less fruitful than we hoped. We have no concrete feedback as to why we had so little response, but we have our assumptions. Firstly, the user group is a very specific group. There might not be that many children living in Trondheim at the age of 3 - 7 years, suffering from asthma, who also have parents willing to participate in our research. Secondly, people tend to not care if they do not get an attractive reward for helping, and since we had little to offer in terms of economical compensation or rewards, the interest might have withered away for some people. Thirdly, there may have been scepticism from the potential test users. While all the different paperwork was in order and the project may prove positive for the children and parents within the target group, the fact that we are two students writing a master thesis may be less encouraging\footnote{We \emph{belive} that if the researchers were publicly acknowledged, it would have been a bit easier to recruit users}.


\subsection{Co-Design Sessions}
\label{sec:codesignsessionsdifficulties}
Our original plan was to arrange co-design sessions with several experts present at the same time. We believe this would have helped the creativity of the feedback for \app{} and \ab{}. However, this proved too difficult to arrange. The persons we wanted to invite were very busy and after several failed attempts to find a time suitable for all experts, we gave up trying to arrange co-design sessions. 

  
\section{Conclusions}
\label{conlusions}

The research questions presented in Chapter \ref{sec:researchquestions} provides a basis for summarization of results discussed in Chapter \ref{chp:results}. 

\paragraph{RQ1: How can gamification be used for motivating children to take their asthma medicine?}



\paragraph{RQ2: How can Tangible Interfaces be used for motivating children to take their asthma medicine?}


\section{Validity of our Results}

\textbf{Sample Size}

The validity of our study suffers from a low sample size of test users. Testing \ab{} and \app{} on three children and two adults are not enough to draw any conclusions of whether or not \app{} and \ab{} has potential to become a successful tool or not. As such, we have included testing on several more children in Chapter \ref{chp:futurework} - Further Work.    

\textbf{Interview transcripts}

Interviews were performed by having one intervieweer and one transcriber, with no means of recording. In hindsight, we should have recorded the interviews in order to process the information more clearly later on. After the transcripts had been translated and clarified, they were sent to our interview subjects for validation of citations.
