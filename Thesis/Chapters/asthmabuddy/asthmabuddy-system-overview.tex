\section{System Overview}

\subsection{Use Cases}
Figure \ref{fig:pi-use-cases} shows a general overview of the use cases we have included in our prototype. A medication process can be started set off two ways:
A parent can register an alarm by using AsthmAPP. This alarm is then set of by the \code{AsthmaBuddy} instance running \footnote{The reader should take notice that the tangible user interface \ab{} differs from the program running on the \rpi{}, which is called \code{AsthmaBuddy}(note the change of font)}, giving the child a notification that it is time to take the relevant medicine.

The alternative to a registered alarm is if a child needs to take the medicine by need. In such case, the child or parent simply registers the RFID-tag before the child is guided through a quicker process (see Manuscript \ref{chp:anuscript}).

\subsection{State Diagram}
\label{sec:statediagram}

In order to start the AsthmaBuddy application, we used SSH in order to gain access to the computer. We then retrieved the latest version of the source code from Git\fnurl{Git is the Source Code Management system we used}{http://git-scm.com/}, compiled it, and started running it (this process is described in Appendix \ref{app:asthmabuddy_manual}). Once AsthmaBuddy is running, it follows the state diagram depicted in Figure \ref{fig:asthmabuddy_statediagram}.

\subsection{Sequence Diagram}
Figures \ref{fig:ab-sd-byneed} - \ref{fig:ab-sd-completing-treatment} shows sequence diagrams of how the system works internally. Some abstractions have been made, in order to reduce the cluster of arrows.

\end{sidewaysfigure}

\textbf{By Need Treatment}

We were not able to find a reasonable easy way to let the \buddy{} automatically be aware of the medicine that was to be taken at the start of a treatment. As a result, we used ssh into the \rpi{}, and provided the color of the medicine and the sequence number for the interaction that was to be tested.

After inserting these parameters, the \code{LogicHandler} retrieves a \code{LinkedList} of \code{Interaction}-objects that is to be played. After this sequence is ended, the system jumps to Figure \ref{fig:ab-sd-instructions}.
 
\textbf{Planned Treatment}

If an \code{AsthmaBuddy} instance is started without any parameters, it starts looking through alarm files (see Section \ref{sec:node-server}) every 60 seconds. If no alarm is returned from \code{UserDataManager}, it waits. Once an alarm is found, \code{AsthmaBuddy} is notified through \code{onNotificationFired}, which starts the treatment process. 
 
\textbf{Playing Instructions}

Playing instructions is mainly a loop of playing a sound, and turning on and off the LED-lights through the \code{LightEmitter} instance. 

\textbf{Finishing a Treatment}

When a treatment is finished, i.e. we are out of the \code{while} loop in Figure \ref{fig:ab-sd-instructions}, we register the treatment in the database. This ensures that the child is able to see the rewards in AsthmAPP. 


\subsection{Node Server}
\label{sec:node-server}
In addition to the Java application running on the \rpi{}, we developed a Node.js server\fnurl{Node.js}{http://nodejs.org/}. This backend system was developed in order to easily visualize the rewards given to a child after a treatment using \buddy{}. The initial problem is that AsthmAPP stores data to a MySQL database, with \code{childId} as the primary key for most tables. Initially, \buddy{} has no way of knowing which \code{childId} to add rewards to, or for which user alarms should be triggered. The current solution to our problem was to develop a Node.js server on AsthmaBuddy, which run as a background process. Whenever we want to switch users, AsthmAPP does an HTTP POST to this server, including the \code{childId} as a parameter. The server then retrives JSON-formatted data from our webservice, which includes the rewards a child has been given until now (for instance, by using a smartphone), and the alarms set for this user. 
When \buddy{} starts running, it checks for alarms to be set off every 60 seconds. When a child has finished a treatment, \code{AsthmaBuddy} updates the database, with the \code{childId} previously retrieved, and the number of stars a child collected during his/her treatment. With the data retrieved from the database, \buddy{} has the capability to tell the user how many stars a child has collected\footnote{Since this is a prototype, this functionality only works until a child has collected 20 stars. It became cumbersome to handle rewards totalling more than 20 stars}. This process is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ab-sd-synchronizing}.
