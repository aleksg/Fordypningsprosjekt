\section{Mobile Computing in Health Care}
Mobile computing is evolving at a rapid pace, and finding new ways to use it in health care is a rising research problem. This section covers the state of the art of some of the areas in which mobile computing is being used.  

\subsection{Electronic Patient Journal}
During 2009, the Norwegian \emph{Ministry of Government Administration, Reform and Church Affairs} decided that an Electronic Patient Journal (EPJ) were to implemented, with the slogan \emph{``One citizen - One journal''}\cite{epjregjering}. This has led to a lot of research problems, both regarding security requirements and usability of the system. Some of the research done on usability of EPJ has included the use of mobile technologies, such as tablets and smartphones, within the medical care facility \cite{svanaes2010usability}.    

\subsection{Meassuring Blood Preassure}
iHealth\fnurl{iHealth}{http://www.ihealthlabs.com/wireless-blood-pressure-monitor-feature_32.htm}, Withings\fnurl{Withings}{http://www.withings.com/en/bloodpressuremonitor/features} and other companies has created blood preassure monitors which are synchronized towards mobile applications. They allow easy monitoring over periods of time, and makes it possible to share meassurements to both friends, family and doctors.


\subsection{Controlling Your Diabetes}
Cellnovo\fnurl{Cellnovo}{http://www.cellnovo.com/} has created a system that helps controlling diabetes. It consists of a handheld device for meassuring blood sugar level, a pump that controls the flow of insulin and a web interface that allows you to access the information. The interface helps users to check for trends and patterns. It also allow users to send information to physicians, which helps them make decisions further regarding how patients are managed.
   
\subsection{Heart Monitor}
Alivecor\fnurl{AliveCor}{http://www.alivecor.com} and eCardio\fnurl{eCardio}{http://www.ecardio.com/} among others have created mobile devices that helps patients monitor their heart rate on the go. 

\subsection{Quit Smoking}
There are lots of mobile applications that are helping people to quit smoking. For instance, \emph{The Norwegian Heart and Lung Patient Organization} has an app for helping people to quit smoking\fnurl{R\o ykeslutt}{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.lhl.roykeslutt}. By reading the reviews, we can see that it has helped motivating people, which has tremendous health benefits.
