\chapter{Background}
\label{chp:background}

This chapter will give a brief introduction to the history behind the BLOPP project (Section \ref{sec:bloppproject}). Section \ref{sec:about-asthma} will give an overview of asthma and how it affects people. Section \ref{sec:cappgappkapp} will go into details of the applications that were developed by Aaberg, Aarseth, Dale, Gisvold and Svalestuen during the Autumn 2012.     
Section \ref{sec:existing-research} will give an introduction to some of the current research that has been performed on mobile technology in combination with children and health.   


\section{BLOPP Project}
\label{sec:bloppproject}
The BLOPP project aimed to explore how design and technology can motivate children with respiratory diseases to take prescribed medication and to promote positive interactions between children and caregivers, thereby increasing adherence to medical treatment. They have previously worked with [FYLL INN].


\section{About Asthma}
\label{sec:about-asthma}
Asthma is a disease that affects the lungs. Asthma causes wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing. It is a chronic disease, but asthma attacks will only occur when something is bothering the lungs. It may be hard to tell if someone has asthma, especially in children under the age five. 


An asthma attack may include coughing, chest tightness, wheezing and trouble breathing. The attack happens in the body's lungs, the airways tighten, letting less oxygen pass through.
According to the Norwegian Minestry of Health and Care Services, acute asthma attacks was the most common reason for hospitalization of children during 2008 \cite{NationalStrategy}. About 20 per cent of children are suffering from the disease, which causes economical consequences for the society \footnote{Costs of having parents at home instead of working, hospitalization costs, medicine costs, etc.}. However, asthma can be controlled and asthma attacks avoided by taking medicine at regular intervals. Some of the medicines are taken as a preventive measure to avoid asthma attacks from occuring. These medicines are Seretide and Flutide. Ventoline is taken before exercise or when an asthma attack occurs, in order to stop/shorten the length of the attack. 


A treatment may be done in different ways, mostly differentiated by the use of a breathing chamber or not. Before use the asthma medicine must be shaken, in order to stir the particles. If a breathing chamber is used, the medicine protection cap is removed and the medicine is mounted on the breathing chamber. The chamber is pressed towards the user's face, covering nose and mouth. The medicine is then pressed, to release the particles into the breathing chamber, and the user breaths calmly for ten seconds. 
The breathing chamber is most often used by small children, while others may use a disk-formed medicine (see Figure and Figure respectively).

\end{figure}

People suffering from asthma are often given an asthma control plan, which tells them how often they should take their medication and what to do if an attack occurs. These plans are often parted into three separate health zones, corresponding with how the user feels. In order to make these health zones understandable, a traffic light system is often used (see Appendix \ref{chp:traffic-light}). A green light tells what the user should do when all is normal. A yellow light indicates what to do when the user is feeling a bit ill, there may be a lot of pollen in the air or otherwise poor air quality or that the user is recovering from a cold. A red light indicates what to do when the user is feeling ill, or there is an extreme amount of pollen or extremely poor air quality.  


\section{CAPP, KAPP and GAPP}
\label{sec:cappgappkapp}
In the autumn of 2012 Aaberg, Aarseth, Dale, Gisvold and Svalestuen were engaged by the BLOPP Project group through the course ``TDT4290 - Customer Driven Project'' at NTNU\fnurl{Course Description of TDT4290 - Customer Driven Project}{http://www.idi.ntnu.no/emner/tdt4290/}. During the period of August 2012 to December 2012 they developed a prototype of a mobile information system consisting of two Android applications and a TUI. One application was developed for parents of a child (GAPP) and one application were developed for children (CAPP). Additionally, they created a Karotz Application (KAPP) targeted at children. In this section, we elaborate on these applications, while a full report of their work is available at\cite{CustomerDriven}. 

Their prototype is the foundation for our work in this project. 


\subsection{CAPP}
\label{sec:description-capp}
CAPP is an Android application targeted at children\footnote{All applications have norwegian as their main language}. It's main purpose is to guide children through the medication process. Figure \ref{fig:capp-main-menu} shows the main page of CAPP.  
As the target group for the application is children below the age of 8, it is reasonable to assume that not all of them are able to read, this application consists mainly of pictures and animations.


In CAPP, it is possible to start a medication in one of two ways. A parent can either set alarms in GAPP (See Section \ref{sec:description-gapp}) for preventive medicines, or a child can access the medication process directly by pressing the Karotz showed in Figure \ref{fig:capp-main-menu}, which is the way to start a by-need-treatment. 


One of the objectives towards CAPP was to introduce a gamification experience to the medication process. Accordingly, the child gets a golden star in his/her treasure chest once the child is done. However, these stars are not useful for anything else but showing them off.
  

By clicking the treasure chest, the child is able to see how many stars he/she has aquired. A screenshot showing the inside of the treasure chest is included in Figure \ref{fig:capp_stars} 


The last part of this application is an Information-section, where children has a quick reference as to how to take a medicine. A part of the functionality that has not been implemented is voice over for these instructions. Thus, a parent should be close by in order to read the information contained in this functionality.     
\ref{fig:instructions-1}-\ref{fig:instructions-7} shows the information-part of this application.

\subsection{KAPP}
\label{sec:description-kapp}
KAPP is the TUI-application targeted at children. The application runs on a Karotz\fnurl{Karotz}{www.karotz.com}, which is a small robot bunny (see Figure \ref{fig:karotz}). The purpose of the KAPP is similar to CAPP, namely to remind children when it is time to take their asthma medicine and give instructions during treatment. In order to interact with the Karotz, children may use either a Nanoz (a small bunny with an integrated RFID) or by pressing a button on the top of the Karotz' head. It is not possible to do a by-need treatment with a Karotz as a companion. 

A basic breakdown of the CAPP and KAPP manuscript is included in Appendix \ref{chp:anuscript}.

		\label{fig:gapp-main-menu1}
	\end{minipage}
\end{figure}


\subsection{GAPP}
\label{sec:description-gapp}
GAPP is an Android application targeted at the guardians or parents of the children. 
Some parents have problems with remembering how often their children have taken their medication the last couple of days, when they should take them and how their children's disease has evolved over the a period of time. Thus, GAPP's main puropose is to make parents more aware of their child's disease.   


Figure \ref{fig:gapp-main-menu1} shows a screenshot of the main menu of GAPP. The main functionality is separated into 
\emph{Medical Plan}, \emph{Register Treatment}, \emph{Medicine Log}, \emph{Medical Information} and \emph{Manual}. 

\paragraph{Medical Plan}
\emph{Medical Plan} gives parents the option to set up reminders at particular times. It is divided according to the Traffic-Light system (See Appendix \ref{chp:traffic-light}). A child has three separate plans, such that an alarm that is set on the \emph{Healthy}-plan is not automatically set on the \emph{Sick}-plan.   

\paragraph{Register Treatment}
The \emph{Register Treatment}-option gives parents the possibility to register a treatment that is taken in case the child for some reason did not go through the process in CAPP or KAPP. This way, children will be rewarded with stars accordingly. Figure \ref{fig:gapp-register-treatment} shows a screen shot of this process.  

\paragraph{Medical Information}
\emph{Medical Information} gives general information about different medicines, what they do and what they are used for. The three medicines that are currently in the system is Flutide, Seretide and Ventoline. Figures \ref{fig:information-1} and \ref{fig:information-2} shows screenshots from this functionality.

\paragraph{Medicine Log}
\emph{Medicine Log} shows how many times a child has taken his/her medicine the last couple of days. Figure \ref{fig:medicine-log} shows a screen shot of this functionality. A red circle marks the current day. A child's health state is displayed by the Green/Yellow/Red bar at the top of each day. In the bottom left corner, it is possible to show how much medicine was taken on a given day.
In the bottom right corner, Aaberg et. al. intended to show the pollen distribution for a given day. However, the pollen distribution data is only available during spring and summer, and thus Aaberg et. al created an artificial pollen distribution for demonstration purposes. 

\paragraph{Manual}
The \emph{Manual} is to help ``newcomers'' to medicate children. For instance, if a relative is watching children with asthma, she could use the application as a reference on how to do the process. At the time being, the manual shows Figures \ref{fig:instructions-1}-\ref{fig:instructions-7}.

\subsection{Known areas for improvement}
\label{sec:improvements}
As Aaberg, Aarseth, Dale, Gisvold and Svalestuen finished their work, they commented on several areas of potential improvement for CAPP, GAPP and KAPP. This document is reprinted in its entirety in Appendix \ref{app:furtherWork} (after permission from Aaberg, Aarseth, Dale, Gisvold and Svalestuen). The main topics for improvement were
\begin{itemize}
\item{Reward System}
\item{Distraction sequence for children}
\item{Web application}
\end{itemize}


These comments are used as a basis when we decide what to improve in this project.
