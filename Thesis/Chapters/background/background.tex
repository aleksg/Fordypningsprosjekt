\chapter{Background}
\label{chp:background}


This chapter will give a brief introduction to the history behind the BLOPP project (\ref{sec:bloppproject}). Section \ref{sec:cappgappkapp} will go into details of the applications that were developed by Aaberg, Aarseth, Dale, Gisvold and Svalestuen during the Autumn 2012.     
Section \ref{sec:existing-research} will give an introduction to some of the current research that has been performed on mobile technology in combination with children and health.   


\section{BLOPP Project}
\label{sec:bloppproject}
Barns LegemiddelOPPlevelser (BLOPP) is a project group working for ``Sykehusapotekene i Midt-Norge'' (Hospital Pharmacies in Mid-Norway). Their purpose is to create easier medical treatments for children through use of technology.

\section{CAPP, KAPP and GAPP}
\label{sec:cappgappkapp}
In the autumn of 2012 Aaberg, Aarseth, Dale, Gisvold and Svalestuen were engaged by the BLOPP Project group through the course ``TDT4290 - Customer Driven Project'' at NTNU \cite{customerdrivenntnu}. During the period of August 2012 to December 2012 they developed a prototype of a mobile information system consisting of two applications and a tangible user interface. One application was developed for guardians of a child (GAPP), and two applications were developed for children (CAPP and KAPP). In this section, we elaborate on these applications, while a full report of their work is available at \cite{customerdrivenntnu}. % TODO: Bytte ut med en URL kanskje?

Their prototype is the foundation for our work in this project.\footnote{The applications have norwegian as their main language} %Hvor kan vi putte dette?

\subsection{CAPP}
\label{sec:description-capp}
CAPP is an Android application targeted towards the children. It's main purpose is to guide children through the medication process. Figure \ref{fig:capp-main-menu} shows the main page of CAPP.  
As the target group for the application is children below the age of 8 it is reasonable to assume that not all of them are able to read, this application consists mainly of pictures and animations.

%TODO: Virker malplassert
There are two main reasons to take an asthma medication; 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item By-need
  \item Preventive
\end{enumerate}

By-need medication is taken when a person gets a sudden asthma attack, while preventive medication is taken in order to reduce the number of asthma attacks [INSERT REFERENCE].
In CAPP, it is possible to start a medication in one of two ways. A parent can either set alarms in GAPP \ref{sec:description-gapp} (preventive), or a child can directly access the medication process by pressing the Karotz showed in Figure \ref{fig:capp-main-menu} (By-need). 


One of the objectives towards CAPP was to introduce a gamification experience to the medication process. Accordingly, the child gets a golden star in his/her treasure chest once the child is done. However, these stars are not useful for anything else but showing them off.
  

By clicking the treasure chest, the child is able to see how many stars he/she has aquired. A screenshot showing the inside of the treasure chest is included in Figure \ref{fig:capp_stars} 


The last part of this application is an Information-section, where children has a quick reference as to how to take a medicine. A part of the functionality that has not been implemented is voice over for these instructions. Thus, a guardian should be close by in order to read the information contained in this functionality.     
\ref{fig:instructions-1}-\ref{fig:instructions-7} shows the information-part of this application.

\subsection{KAPP}
\label{sec:description-kapp}
KAPP is the other application targeted towards children. The application runs on a Karotz\cite{karotz}, which is a small robot bunny (see Figure \ref{fig:karotz}). The purpose of the Karotz is similar to CAPP, namely to remind children when it is time to take their asthma medicine and give instructions during treatment. In order to interact with the Karotz, children may use either a Nanoz (a small bunny with an integrated RFID) or by pressing a button on the top of the Karotz' head. It is not possible to do a By-Need treatment with a Karotz as a companion. 

A basic breakdown of the CAPP and KAPP manuscript is included in Appendix \ref{chp:anuscript}.

	\end{minipage}
\end{figure}


\subsection{GAPP}
\label{sec:description-gapp}
GAPP is an Android application targeted towards the parents or guardians of the children. 
It has been proven that some Guardians are having problems with remembering how often their children have taken their medication the last couple of days, when they should take them and how their child's desease has evolved the last couple of days [Insert reference]. Thus, GAPP's main puropose is to make parents more aware of their children's desease.   


Figure \ref{fig:gapp-main-menu1} shows a screenshot of the main menu of GAPP. The main functionality is separated into 
\emph{Medical Plan}, \emph{Register treatment}, \emph{Medicine log}, \emph{Information about the medicines} and \emph{Manual}. 

\paragraph{Medical Plan}
\emph{Medical plan} gives parents the option to set up reminders at particular times. It is divided according to the Traffic-Light system (See Appendix \ref{chp:traffic-light}). A child has three different plans, such that an alarm that is set on the \emph{Healthy}-plan is not automatically set on the \emph{Sick}-plan.   

\paragraph{Register Treatment}
The \emph{Register treatment}-option gives parents possibility to register a treatment that is taken in case the child forgot to go through the process in CAPP or KAPP. This way, children will be rewarded with stars accordingly. Figure \ref{fig:gapp-register-treatment} shows a screen shot of this process.  

\paragraph{Medicine Information}
\emph{Medicine information} gives general information about different medicines, what they do, and what they are used for. The three medicines that are currently in the system is Flutide, Seretide and Ventoline. Figures \ref{fig:information-1} and \ref{fig:information-2} shows screenshots from this functionality.
%Functionality vs process  

\paragraph{Medicine Log}
\emph{Medicine log} shows how many times a child has taken their medicine the last couple of days. Figure \ref{fig:medicine-log} shows a screen shot of this functionality. A red circle marks the current day. A child's health state is displayed by the Green/Yellow/Red bar at the top of each day. In the bottom left corner, it is possible to show how much medicine has taken at a given day.
In the bottom right corner, Aaberg et. al. intended to show the pollen distribution for a given day. However, the pollen distribution data is only available during spring and summer, and thus created an artificial pollen distribution for demonstration purposes. [Hvor mye mer trengs her?]. 

\paragraph{Manual}
The \emph{Manual} is to help ``newcomers'' to medicate children. For instance, if an aunt is watching children with asthma, then they could use the application as a reference on how to do the process. At the time being, the manual shows Figures \ref{fig:instructions-1}-\ref{fig:instructions-7}.

\subsection{Known areas for improvement}
\label{sec:improvements}
As Aaberg et al. finished their work, they commented on several areas of potential improvement for CAPP/GAPP/KAPP. This document is reprinted in its entirety in Appendix \ref{app:furtherWork} (after permission from Aaberg, Aarseth, Dale, Gisvold and Svalestuen). The main topics for improvement were
\begin{itemize}
\item{Reward System}
\item{Distraction sequence for children}
\item{Web application}
\end{itemize}


These comments are used as a basis when we decide what to improve in this project.
