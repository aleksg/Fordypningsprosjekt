\chapter{Background}
\label{chp:background}


This chapter will give a brief introduction to the history behind the BLOPP project (\ref{sec:bloppproject}) and the CAPP, GAPP and Karotz applications. 
Section \ref{sec:exisiting-products} gives an overview of some of the applications that are currently on the market, a brief look at some of them, in addition to an overview of an assessment that has been performed on the applications that are currently on the market.   
Section \ref{sec:existing-research} will give an introduction to some of the current research that has been performed on mobile technology in combination with children and health.   


\section{BLOPP Project}
\label{sec:bloppproject}
Barns LegemiddelOPPlevelser (BLOPP) is a project group working for ``Sykehusapotekene i Midt-Norge'' (Hospital pharmacies in Mid-Norway). Their purpose is to create easier medical treatments for children through use of technology.

\section{CAPP, KAPP and GAPP}
\label{sec:cappgappkapp}
In the autumn of 2012 Aaberg, Aarseth, Dale, Gisvold and Svalestuen were engaged by the BLOPP Project group through the course ``TDT4290 - Customer Driven Project'' \cite{customerdrivenntnu} at NTNU. During the period of August 2012 to December 2012 they developed a prototype of a mobile information system consisting of two applications and a tangible user interface. One application was developed for guardians of a child (GAPP), and two applications were developed for children (CAPP and KAPP). In this section, we discuss them further in detail, while a full report of their work is available at [Insert Reference].

Their prototype is the foundation for our work in this project.\footnote{The applications have norwegian as their main language} %Hvor kan vi putte dette?

\subsection{CAPP}
CAPP is an Android application targeted towards the children. It launches the alarms given by parents and guides children during their medication. When the alarm is launched, the medication process starts, where the child is taken through the process by an avatar in the application. 


One of the objectives towards CAPP was to introduce a gamification experience to the process. Accordingly, the child gets a golden star in his/her treasure chest once the child is done, however, these stars were not useful for anything else but showing them off.

As the target group for the application is children below the age of 8 it is reasonable to assume that not all of them are able to read, this application consists mainly of pictures.  
Figure \ref{fig:capp-main-menu} shows a screen shot of the main page.

\end{figure}



\subsection{KAPP}
KAPP is the other application targeted towards children. The application runs on a Karotz\cite{karotz}, which is a small robot bunny (see Figure \ref{fig:karotz}). The purpose of the Karotz is similar to CAPP, namely to remind children when it is time to take their asthma medicine and give instructions during treatment. In order to interact with the Karotz, children may use either a Nanoz (a small bunny with an integrated RFID) or by pressing a button on the top of the Karotz' head. In addition, it is possible to interact through the Karotz' ears, but from our part, this has not been experimented with.

\end{figure}


\subsection{GAPP}
GAPP is an Android application targeted towards the parents or guardians of the children. 
Currently, guardians are having problems with remembering how often their children have taken their medicine the last couple of days, when they should take them and how their child's desease has evolved the last couple of days. The purpose of GAPP is to let guardians monitor their child's medication usage the last couple of days, setting up reminders, etc.

Figure \ref{fig:gapp-main-menu1} shows a screenshot of the main menu of GAPP. The main functionality is separated into 
\emph{Medical Plan}, \emph{Register treatment}, \emph{Medicine log}, \emph{Medicine information} and \emph{Manual}. 
Medical Plan gives parents the option to set up reminders at particular times. 

The ``Register treatment''-option gives parents possibility to register a treatment that is taken in case the child forgot to go through the process in CAPP or KAPP. This way, children will be rewarded with stars accordingly. 
``Medicine information'' gives general information about different medicines, what they do, and what they help against.  
``Medicine log'' shows how many times a child has taken their medicine the last couple of days.
The manual is to help ``newcomers'' to medicate children. For instance, if an aunt is watching children with asthma, then they could use the application as a reference on how to do the process. 
        
        
It's basic functionality is to view logs on how often a child needs medication, how the child has been feeling the last couple of days, according to the asthma traffic light system, and to set up alarms for the child. 
CAPP and GAPP work together as a pair, and thus the log will show the logged treatments of their child. 


\subsection{Known areas for improvement}
\label{sec:improvements}
As Aaberg et al. finished their work, they commented on several areas of potential improvement for CAPP/GAPP/KAPP. This document is reprinted in its entirety in Appendix \ref{app:furtherWork} (after permission from Aaberg, Aarseth, Dale, Gisvold and Svalestuen). The main topics for improvement were
\begin{itemize}
\item{Reward System}
\item{Distraction sequence for children}
\item{Web application}
\item{Support for more children}
\end{itemize}

Additionally, we want to use air quality data provided by \href{http://luftkvalitet.info}{Norwegian Institute for Air Research} 

These comments are used as a basis when we decide what to improve in this project.
