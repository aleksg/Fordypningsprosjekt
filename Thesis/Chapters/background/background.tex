\chapter{Background}
\label{chp:background}


This chapter will give a brief introduction to the history behind the BLOPP project [insert reference] and the CAPP, GAPP and Karotz applications.


\section{BLOPP Project}
\label{sec:bloppproject}
Barns LegemiddelOPPlevelser (BLOPP) is a project group working for ``Sykehusapotekene i Midt-Norge'' (Hospital pharmacies in Mid-Norway). Their purpose is to create easier medical treatments for children through use of technology.

\section{CAPP/GAPP/KAPP}
\label{sec:cappgappkapp}
In the autumn of 2012 Aaberg, Aarseth, Dale, Gisvold and Svalestuen were engaged by the BLOPP Project group through the course ``TDT4290 - Customer Driven Project'' \cite{customerdrivenntnu} at NTNU. During the period of August 2012 to December 2012 they developed a prototype of a mobile information system consisting of three applications. One application were developed for guardians of a child (GAPP), and two applications were developed for children (CAPP and KAPP). In this section, we discuss them further in detail, while a full report of their work is available at [Insert Reference].

Their prototype is the foundation for our work in this project.

\subsection{CAPP}
CAPP is an Android application targeted towards the children. It launches the alarms given by parents and guides children during their medication. When the alarm is launched, the medication process starts, where the child is taken through the process by a Karotz on the application. 


One of the objectives towards CAPP was to introduce a gamification experience to the process. Accordingly, the child gets a golden star in his/her treasure chest once the child is done.

As the target group for the application is children below the age where it is reasonable to assume that they are able to read, this application consists mainly of pictures.  
Figure \ref{fig:capp-main-menu} shows a screen shot of the main page.

\end{figure}



\subsection{KAPP}
KAPP is the other application targeted towards children. The application runs on a Karotz\cite{karotz}, which is a small robot bunny (see Figure \ref{fig:karotz}). The purpose of the Karotz is similar to CAPP, namely to remind children when it is time to take their asthma medicine and give instructions during treatment. In order to interact with the Karotz, children may use either a Nanoz (a small bunny with an integrated RFID) or by pressing a button on the top of the Karotz' head. In addition, it is possible to interact through the Karotz' ears, but from our part, this has not been experimented with (yet).

\subsection{GAPP}
GAPP is an Android application targeted towards the parents or guardians of the children. 
Currently, guardians are having problems with remembering how often their children have taken their medicine the last couple of days, when they should take them and how their child's desease has evolved the last couple of days. The purpose of GAPP is to let guardians monitor their child's medication usage the last couple of days, setting up reminders, etc.

Figure \ref{fig:gapp-main-menu} shows a screenshot of the main menu of GAPP. The main functionality is separated into 
\emph{Medical Plan}, \emph{Register medicine}, \emph{Medicine log}, \emph{Medicine information} and \emph{Manual}. 
Medical Plan gives parents the option to set up reminders at particular times. 

The Register medicine-option gives parents possibility to register a medicine that is taken in case the child forgot to go through the process in CAPP or KAPP. This way, children gets their stars in the treasure chest. 
Medicine information gives general information about different medicines, what they do, and what they help against.  
Medicine log shows how many times a child has taken their medicine the last couple of days.
The manual is to help ``newcomers'' to medicate children. For instance, if an aunt is watching children with asthma, then they could use the application as a reference on how to do the process.

		\caption{GAPP main menu}
		\label{fig:gapp-main-menu}
\end{figure}
Its basic functionality is to view logs on how often a child needs medication, how the child has been feeling the last couple of days, according to the asthma traffic light system, and to set up alarms for the child. 
CAPP and GAPP work together as a pair, so a child may only have one parent and vice versa. %Er siste setning n��dvendig


\subsection{Known areas for improvement}
\label{sec:improvements}
As Aaberg, Aarseth, Dale, Gisvold and Svalestuen finished their work, they commented on several areas of potential improvement for CAPP/GAPP/KAPP. This document is reprinted in its entirety in Appendix \ref{app:furtherWork} (after permission from Aaberg, Aarseth, Dale, Gisvold and Svalestuen). The main topics for improvement were
\begin{itemize}
\item{Reward System}
\item{Distraction sequence for children}
\item{Web application}
\item{Support for more children}
\end{itemize}

These comments are used as a basis when we decide what to improve in this project. 
%In addition, we have discovered a potential in sending out emails with records, which perhaps will go directly to the child's doctor. Hvor skal vi skrive om dette?
