\chapter{Background}
\label{chp:background}

This chapter will give a brief introduction to the history behind the BLOPP project (Section \ref{sec:bloppproject}). Section \ref{sec:about-asthma} will describe asthma and how it affects people. Section \ref{sec:cappgappkapp} will go into details of the applications that were developed by Aaberg, Aarseth, Dale, Gisvold and Svalestuen during the autumn of 2012.     
Section \ref{sec:existing-research} will give an introduction to some of the recent research that has been performed on mobile technology in combination with children and health.   


\section{BLOPP Project}
\label{sec:bloppproject}
The goal of the BLOPP project was to explore how design and technology can motivate children with respiratory diseases to take prescribed medication and to promote positive interactions between children and caregivers, thereby increasing adherence to medical treatment. BLOPP had previously worked with Asheim's ``Concept for improved treatment of children affected by asthma/RS- virus''\cite{asheim2012konsept} and H\o iseth's ``Research-Derived Guidelines for Designing Toddlers' Healthcare Games'' \cite{hoiseth2013research}, in addition to several other projects.


\section{About Asthma}
\label{sec:about-asthma}
Asthma is a disease that affects the lungs. Asthma causes wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing. It is a chronic disease, but asthma attacks will only occur when something is bothering the lungs. Asthma may be difficult to diagnose, especially in children under the age of five. 


An asthma attack may include coughing, chest tightness, wheezing and trouble breathing. The attack takes place in the lungs, the airways tighten letting less oxygen pass through.
According to the Norwegian Minestry of Health and Care Services, acute asthma attacks were the most common reason for hospitalization of children in 2008\cite{NationalStrategy}. In Norway, about 20 per cent of children are suffering from the disease, and because of this the condition may be said to have an effect on the economics of the society\footnote{Costs of having parents at home instead of working, hospitalization costs, medicine costs, etc.}. However, asthma can be controlled and asthma attacks avoided by taking medicine at regular intervals. Some of the medicines, such as Seretide and Flutide, are taken as a preventive measure to avoid asthma attacks. Ventoline is taken before exercise or when an asthma attack occurs, in order to stop/shorten the length of the attack. We will refer to this usage as ``By Need'' treatments. 

A treatment may be done in different ways. For young children a nebulizer is often used. The nebulizer is a device used to reduce liquid to an extremely fine cloud, in order to make it easier to inhale. Treatments using a nebulizer may last up to 10 or 15 minutes.

Older children use medication in spray or powder form (see Figure \ref{fig:inhalermask} and Figure \ref{fig:ventolinedisk} respectively). The spray is often used with a breathing chamber, and the powder form of medication is taken straight from the disk. Before use, the container of the asthma medicine must be shaken in order to stir the particles. If a breathing chamber is used, the protection cap is removed and the container is mounted on the breathing chamber. The chamber is pressed towards the user's face, covering the nose and mouth. The container is then pressed, to release the medicine into the breathing chamber, and the user breaths deeply for ten seconds\footnote{There are different ways to conduct a treatment. Some specialists advice to take six breaths instead of breathing for 10 seconds}. 

\subsection{Ways Asthma Affect the Family}
\label{sec:waysasthmaaffectthefamily}
Before sending children to school or kindergarten, remembering to give the child his/her medication may prove challenging for the parents. Often the child does not enjoy taking his/her medicine, and the child may start an argument, not wanting to finish the treatment. This may result in parents applying the medication incorrectly, applying the wrong treatment, or even forgetting to give the medicine, which in turn may have a negative effect on the overall treatment.

	\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

People suffering from asthma are often given an asthma control plan, which tells them how often they should take their medication and what to do if an attack occurs. These plans are often parted into three separate health zones, corresponding with how the user feels. In order to make these health zones understandable, a traffic light system is often used (see Appendix \ref{chp:traffic-light}). The green treatment plan tells what the user should do when all is normal. The yellow treatment plan indicates what to do when the user is feeling a bit ill, when there is a lot of pollen in the air or otherwise poor air quality or when the user is recovering from a cold. The red treatment plan indicates what to do when the user is feeling ill, or there is an extreme amount of pollen in the air or extremely poor air quality. If the red treatment plan is necessary, the child often has to consult a doctor. 


\section{CAPP, KAPP and GAPP}
\label{sec:cappgappkapp}
In the autumn of 2012 Aaberg, Aarseth, Dale, Gisvold and Svalestuen were engaged by the BLOPP Project group through the course ``TDT4290 - Customer Driven Project'' at NTNU\fnurl{Course Description of TDT4290 - Customer Driven Project}{http://www.idi.ntnu.no/emner/tdt4290/}. During the period of August 2012 to December 2012 they developed a prototype of a mobile information system consisting of two Android applications and a TUI. One application was developed for guardians of a child (GAPP) and the other for children (CAPP). Additionally, they created a Karotz application (KAPP) targeted at children. In this section, we describe these applications, while a full report of their work is available at\cite{CustomerDriven}. 

Their prototype was the basis for our work in this project. 


\subsection{CAPP}
\label{sec:description-capp}
CAPP is an Android application targeted at children. Its main purpose is to guide the child through the medication process. Figure \ref{fig:capp-main-menu} shows the main page of CAPP \footnote{All applications have Norwegian as their main language}.  
As the target group for the application is children below the age of 8, it is reasonable to assume that not all of them are able to read, and consequently this application consists mainly of pictures and animations.


In CAPP, it is possible to start a medication in one of two ways. A parent can either set alarms in GAPP (See Section \ref{sec:description-gapp}) for preventive medicines, or a child can access the medication process directly by pressing the Karotz showed in Figure \ref{fig:capp-main-menu}, which is the way to start a by-need-treatment. 


One of the objectives of CAPP was to introduce a gamification experience to the medication process. Accordingly, the child recieved a golden star in his/her treasure chest once the medicine has been taken. However, these stars cannot be used for anything, they are solely for display.
  

By clicking the treasure chest, the child is able to see how many stars he/she has aquired. A screenshot showing the inside of the treasure chest is included in Figure \ref{fig:capp_stars} 


The last part of this application is an Information-section, where information as to how to take a medicine is ready available. A part of the functionality that has not been implemented is voice over for these instructions. Thus, a parent should be close by in order to read the information contained in this functionality.     
\ref{fig:instructions-1} -\ref{fig:instructions-7} shows the information-part of this application.

\end{figure}


\subsection{KAPP}
\label{sec:description-kapp}
KAPP is the TUI-application targeted at children. The application runs on a Karotz\fnurl{Karotz}{www.karotz.com}, which is a small robot bunny (see Figure \ref{fig:karotz}). The purpose of the KAPP is similar to CAPP, namely to remind children when it is time to take the asthma medicine and give instructions during treatment. In order to interact with the Karotz, the child may use either a Nanoz (a small bunny with an integrated RFID) or by pressing a button on the top of the Karotz' head. It is not possible to do a by-need treatment with a Karotz as a companion. 

A basic breakdown of the CAPP and KAPP manuscript is included in Appendix \ref{chp:anuscript}.

		\caption{GAPP main menu}
		\label{fig:gapp-main-menu1}
	\end{minipage}
\end{figure}


\subsection{GAPP}
\label{sec:description-gapp}
GAPP is an Android application targeted at the guardians or parents of the child. 
Some parents have problems with remembering how often their child has taken his/her medication the last couple of days, when the child should take the medication and how the child's disease has evolved over a period of time. Thus, GAPP's main puropose is to make parents more aware of their child's disease.   


Figure \ref{fig:gapp-main-menu1} shows a screenshot of the main menu of GAPP. The main functionality is separated into 
\emph{Medical Plan}, \emph{Register Treatment}, \emph{Medicine Log}, \emph{Medical Information} and \emph{Manual}. 

\paragraph{Medical Plan}
\emph{Medical Plan} gives parents the option to set up reminders at particular times. It is divided according to the Traffic-Light system (See Appendix \ref{chp:traffic-light}). A child has three separate plans, to ensure that an alarm that is set on the \emph{Healthy}-plan is not automatically set on the \emph{Sick}-plan.   

\paragraph{Register Treatment}
The \emph{Register Treatment}-option gives parents the possibility to register a treatment that was carried out in case the child for some reason did not go through the process in CAPP or KAPP. This way, the child will be rewarded with stars accordingly. Figure \ref{fig:gapp-register-treatment} shows a screen shot of this process.  

\paragraph{Medical Information}
\emph{Medical Information} gives general information about different medicines, what they do and what they are used for. The three medicines that are currently in the system is Flutide, Seretide and Ventoline. Figures \ref{fig:information-1} and \ref{fig:information-2} shows screenshots of this functionality.

\paragraph{Medicine Log}
\emph{Medicine Log} shows how many times a child has taken his/her medicine the last months. Figure \ref{fig:medicine-log} shows a screen shot of this functionality. A red circle marks the current day. A child's health state is displayed by the Green/Yellow/Red bar at the top of each day. In the bottom left corner, it is possible to show how much medicine was taken on a given day.
In the bottom right corner, Aaberg et. al. intended to show the pollen distribution for a given day. However, the pollen distribution data is only available during spring and summer, and thus Aaberg et. al created an artificial pollen distribution for demonstration purposes. 

\paragraph{Manual}
The purpose of the \emph{Manual} is to help ``newcomers'' to medicate their child. For instance, if a relative is watching a child with asthma, he/she could use the application as a reference on how to do the process. At the time being, the manual shows Figures \ref{fig:instructions-1} - \ref{fig:instructions-7}.

\subsection{Known Areas For Improvement}
\label{sec:improvements}
As Aaberg \etal{} finished their work, they commented on several areas of potential improvement for CAPP, GAPP and KAPP. This document is reprinted in its entirety in Appendix \ref{app:furtherWork} (after permission from Aaberg, Aarseth, Dale, Gisvold and Svalestuen). The main topics for improvement were
\begin{itemize}
\item{Reward System}
\item{Distraction sequence for children}
\item{Web application}
\end{itemize}


These comments were used as a basis when we decided what to improve in this project.
