\chapter{Further Work}
\label{chp:futurework}

AsthmAPP and AsthmaBuddy are early prototypes, and need further work and changes before finalization. This chapter presents different solutions to previously mentioned evaluation and other changes based on user feedback.

As stated in Section \ref{sec:gamificationdiscussion}, the motivational effect of gamification withers over time. We have not been able to test our prototypes over a longer period of time, and there is an existing risk that \buddy{} and AsthmAPP will become less interesting over time.

\section{Future Work on \ab{}}
\label{sec:futureworkab}
During our research, \ab{} was operated using the Wizard-of-Oz technique. A future version of \ab{} should have different methods for interaction, such as touch sensors, separate actions for replaying instructions and feedback on user interaction. 

There are many possibilities for functionality that may be included in \ab{}. These are listed in Chapter \ref{sec:resultstui}. This list is not exhaustive, and there is still much research that may be done in this field of expertise. 

\section{Future Work on \app{}}
\label{sec:futureworkapp}
\app{} has some issues regarding usability which we have already discovered. However, thorough iterations of user testing and improvements will be necessary in order for \app{} to become a success. Low usability will frustrate the user and may bias the research, and if \app{} should be used for future research it will need these improvements. 

There are several possibilities for functionality that may be added to \app{}. Examples of this are keeping track of dosages left in a container, with automatic user warning if there are less than X amounts left. Functionality for telling how many dosages was planned and how many were taken may give a better overview for the use over time. Since the amount of dosages varies with the treatment plan, such functionality would make it easier to check how well the treatment plan was followed over time. 

The calendar/log in \app{} now only supports showing a month at a time. Viewing one week or one day at the time would be useful to get a more closer view of the use of medicine. Logging when a medicine was taken, down to the minute may also be interesting for users. 

\app{} only supports one child. There are no way to track more than one child per app, which may cause problems for parents who was two or more children suffering for asthma. In a future version of \app{} there should be support for more than one child. \ab{} has support for being used by different users, but the alarm functionality will only run for one user at the time, and will block other users for starting a treatment while it's waiting for an alarm. Future \ab{} should be able to keep track of more than one child at the time.
