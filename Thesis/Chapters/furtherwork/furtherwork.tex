\chapter{Further Work}
\label{chp:futurework}

AsthmAPP and AsthmaBuddy are early prototypes, and need further work and changes before finalization. This chapter presents different solutions to previously mentioned evaluation and other changes based on user feedback.

As stated in Section \ref{sec:gamificationdiscussion}, the motivational effect of gamification withers over time. We have not been able to test our prototypes over a longer period of time, and there is an existing risk that \buddy{} and AsthmAPP will become less interesting over time.
