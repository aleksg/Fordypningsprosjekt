\chapter{Further Work}
\label{chp:futurework}

AsthmAPP and AsthmaBuddy are early prototypes, and need further work and changes before finalization. This chapter presents different solutions to previously mentioned evaluation and other changes based on user feedback.

As stated in Section \ref{sec:gamificationdiscussion}, the motivational effect of gamification withers over time. We have not been able to test our prototypes over a longer period of time, and there is an existing risk that \buddy{} and AsthmAPP will become less interesting over time.

\section{Future Research}

During our research we have discovered a few research areas that could be explored further. This section aims to cover some of those. 

\textbf{Other Treatments}

The underlying concept behind our prototypes, i.e. use of gamification and tangible user interfaces, could be explored further for other diseases than asthma. For instance, testing our approach on diabetics or childen with heart defects. We have faith in the motivational factors that gamification introduces in the treatment of sick children. 

\textbf{Gamification Elements to Treat Ashmatic Children}

We have introduced a broad specter of gamification elements we considered using in \app{} and \ab{}. We can not guarantee that the set of gamification elements used in \app{} and \ab{} are the most effective, in terms of providing motivation, information or enjoyment, but it is a start. 

Researching the different possibilities of combining these elements will become a key for the eventual success a product such as ours could have.    


\textbf{Tools for Kindergarten Personell}

During our interview with a kindergarten teacher (see Appendix \ref{sec:parent2interview}), we discovered the possibility for creating a tool to help kindergarten and school teachers with treatment of asthmatic children. This could be extended to concern other diseases as well. Guiding adults through treatments they are not used to perform could be important and potentially life saving for children, as they are not around their parents at all time at any given day.
