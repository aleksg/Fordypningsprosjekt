\section{Personalized Access Control for a Personally Controlled Health Record}
\label{personalhealthrecords}

One of the most wanted features for CAPP/GAPP/KAPP was to be able to share the treatment history recorded in the application with the doctor's office. Keeping a medical journal is no revolution, but sharing detailed information about treatment history in the way CAPP/GAPP/KAPP does is not done today. The guardians and physician's opinions about this sharing of information is one of the central questions we aim to answer, as mentioned in \ref{sec:researchquestions}.
