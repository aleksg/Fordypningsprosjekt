\section{Personalized Access Control for a Personally Controlled Health Record}
\label{personalhealthrecords}

One of the most wanted features for CAPP/GAPP/KAPP was to be able to share the treatment history recorded in the application with the doctor's office. Keeping a medical journal is no revolution, but sharing detailed information about treatment history in the way CAPP/GAPP/KAPP does is not done today. The guardians and physician's opinions about this sharing of information is one of the central questions we aim to answer, as mentioned in \ref{sec:researchquestions}.

The idea of a complete Patient/Personally Controlled Health Record was presented by Mandl et al.\cite{mandl2007indivo} in 2001. The idea is to assemble the complete health history of the patient in one place. Røstad and Nytrø \cite{rostad2008personalized} made a list of security requirements for PCHR, one of which is ``The patient is administrator of access to his/her information. THe patient decides what permissions to assign to who''. This specific requirement and other requirements\cite{rostad2008personalized} have been taken into consideration when developing CAPP/GAPP/KAPP.
