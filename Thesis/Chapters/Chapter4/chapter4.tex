\chapter{Security Requirements}
\label{securityrequirements}

This chapter will give a brief explanation of the security requirements enforced upon systems and applications that store medical information about Norwegian inhabitants. 


\section{Norwegian Law}
\label{helseregisterloven}

Norway has specific laws for storing of medical information. The most important law is ``The Health Register Act\footnote{Lov om helseregistre og behandling av helseopplysninger}''\cite{helseregisterloven}. This law regulates who are allowed to store health records and how they are supposed to store the records, among other regulations. 

The most important consequences are that we will need permission from ``The Norwegian Data Protection Authority''\footnote{Datatilsynet} in order to store medical records in our application, and that the information has to be stored on servers on Norwegian soil. This eliminates the option of using cloud-based storage. 

%Jeg er ikke fornøyd med dette kapittelet. Skal jobbe mer med det når vi får svar fra Datatilsynet. /Aleks

\section{Measures for Anonymization}
As The Health Register Act states in \S 16 \cite{helseregisterloven} all information that may identify a person, must be encrypted\footnote{There is no notion as of what level of encryption is required}. 

Since we have no interest in the data values or the personal information of our test persons we made the following measurements to completely anonymize the data:
